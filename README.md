# Important JavaScript concepts.

In this repository, I have gathered some of the most important concepts in JavaScript:

- Data types
- Primitive/Reference values
- Scope
- Hoisting
- Let vs Const
- Closures
- IIFE's
- Bind, Call, and Apply
- this 
- Objects (and prototypes)
- Classes
- Callbacks (and the event loop)
- Promises
- Intervals

For some of them, I have added articles that helped me understand the concept. Full list of articles can be found below. 

## To clone the repo, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimianni/JS_Concepts.git
```

## Usage

Type in 'node' and 'filename' in the terminal to execute the code. For instance:

```bash
node run 01_types.js
```

NOTE: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) has to be installed globally on your machine. It is an environment which allows the execution of JavaScript locally on your machine.

TIP: after typing 'node 02' press TAB to autocomplete the file name.
